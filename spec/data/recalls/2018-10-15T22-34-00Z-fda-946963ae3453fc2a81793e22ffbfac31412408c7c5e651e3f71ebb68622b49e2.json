FDA analysis has found Zero Xtreme to be tainted with sibutramine. Sibutramine is an appetite suppressant that was withdrawn from the U.S. market due to safety concerns. The presence of Sibutramine in Zero Xtreme renders it an unapproved drug for which safety and efficacy has not been established and, therefore, subject to recall.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm623503.htm","publicationDate":"2018-10-15T22:34:00.000Z","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["drugs"],"contaminants":[],"distribution":["AL","AK","AZ","AR","CA","CO","CT","DE","DC","FL","GA","HI","ID","IL","IN","IA","KS","KY","LA","ME","MD","MA","MI","MN","MS","MO","MT","NE","NV","NH","NJ","NM","NY","NC","ND","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI","SC","SD","TN","TX","UT","VT","VA","WA","WV","WI","WY"],"risk":"none"}}}
