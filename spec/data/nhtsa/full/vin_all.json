IT SEEMS TO BE COMPLETELY RANDOM.  I HAVE BEEN TO TWO DEALERSHIPS, AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO DRIVE WITH A TECH WHO FELT THE \"SLIPPAGE\".

THEY ALSO TOLD ME TIRE PRESSURE MIGHT AFFECT IT.  NONE OF THIS SITS RIGHT WITH ME BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED DRIVING A CAR WHEN ABS KICKS IN, AND THIS IS NOT THE SENSATION I AM GETTING IN THE PRIUS.  \"SLIPPING\" IS THE BEST ADJECTIVE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT IS TERRIFYING.  THE LAST TIME I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE BRAKES AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE CORPORATE HAD BEEN CONTACTED PREVIOUSLY, THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEM.  THEY DIDN'T KEEP THE CAR, AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD CALL ME BACK WHEN THE CORPORATE REP WOULD BE THERE SO HE COULD DRIVE WITH ME.  THAT WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND THEY HAVEN'T CALLED BACK, OR RETURNED MY CALL.  AT THIS POINT, I FEEL LIKE TOYOTA IS HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME AND I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST IN THE BRAND.

THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO OPERATE BLINDLY IN MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN AND WILL ACCELERATE TO USER-SET SPEED EVEN WHEN A CAR IS TRAVELING SLOWER IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF MY VEHICLE.   I STRONGLY SUSPECT THE PRE-COLLISION BRAKING IS FAILING AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DYNAMIC CRUISE (IN RAIN) SINCE IT RELIES ON THE SAME COMPONENTS.  \r\n\r\nTHE PRIUS PRIME NEEDS TO BE REPROGRAMMED TO NOT ALLOW DYNAMIC CRUISE ENGAGEMENT IN MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN.  \r\n\r\nTHIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE DRIVER VISIBILITY IS ALREADY IMPAIRED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

I DON'T REMEMBER GETTING HIT BY AN OBJECT WHILE DRIVING.  YESTERDAY THE CRACKS GOTTEN  LONGER.  CHECKED THICKNESS BETWEEN MY FINGER, IT LOOKS THE SAME AS THAT OF A DRINKING GLASS.  A QUICK SEARCH ON INTERNET REVEALED THAT IT IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH 2016 OR NEWER MODEL.  CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT IS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT.\r\nI HAVE OWED OTHER VEHICLES MADE BY TOYOTA AND HONDA THAT WERE HIT WITH FLYING OBJECT WITH NO PROBLEM.  EVEN WITH CRACK, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE SPIRALED OUT THAT FAST AND LARGE.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE TO SEE IF IT IS DESIGN MISTAKE IN PURSUE OF WEIGHT REDUCTION.  THANK YOU.",

AS YOU WILL SEE FROM MY ATTACHED DOCUMENT THIS FUNCTION REALLY DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.

I HAVE DRIVEN AT LEAST 5 PRIUS PRIME ADVANCED AND ALL HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THAT THE STEERING ASSIST FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK IN ANY OF THEM EVEN THOUGH IT IS ADVERTISED AND SOLD TO THE CONSUMER AS A INTEGRAL PART OF THE TOYOTA SAFETY SUITE THAT IS ON ALL TOYOTA VEHICLES. THIS STEERING ASSIST FUNCTION DOES WORK ON ALL OF THE OTHER TOYOTA MODELS AS ADVERTISED AND AS A CONSUMER WOULD EXPECT. PLEASE REVIEW MY ATTACHED DOCUMENT THAT DESCRIBES THE PROBLEM AND MY ATTEMPTS TO GET TOYOTA TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THE STOCK ANSWER I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MOST TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT THE STEERING ASSIST \"WORKS AS IT IS ENGINEERED TO DO\" MY STOCK ANSWER TO THIS IS WHY DOES IT FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERY OTHER VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH THE TOYOTA SAFETY SUITE.

HOWEVER, I SEE AN UNNECESSARY RISK DUE TO THIS DESIGN.\r\n\r\nMY NEW CAR, A 2017 PRIUS 4 TOURING, COMES WITH NO SPARE TIRE. THERE ARE THREE PRIUS MODELS LIKE THAT, EVEN FOR THE 2018 MODEL YEAR. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE RELATED SAFETY ASPECTS OF THAT TOYOTA DECISION?\r\n\r\nIN THE WESTERN US, ESPECIALLY, THERE ARE MANY PAVED ROADS WITH LITTLE OR NO TRAFFIC AND SPOTTY, IF ANY, CELL PHONE SERVICE. TYPICALLY, THEY ARE IN DESERT AREAS, SCORCHING IN THE SUMMER, FRIGID IN WINTER, WITH TOWNS FAR APART. IF A DRIVER OF A CAR LIKE MINE HAS A TIRE BLOWOUT IN SUCH A REMOTE AREA, HE/SHE IS LITERALLY STRANDED. THE SUPPLIED TIRE REPAIR KIT WILL NOT HELP IN CASE OF A BLOWOUT. AVERAGE OWNERS WILL NOT EVEN KNOW THEY ARE WITHOUT A SPARE TIRE UNTIL THEY NEED ONE.\r\n\r\nMORE THAN AN INCONVENIENCE, THIS COULD BE FATAL TO THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS IN EXTREME HEAT OR COLD. THE DRIVER\u0092S ONLY HOPE IS THAT ANOTHER VEHICLE WILL HAPPEN ALONG TO HELP. A RISK LIKE THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY A MANUFACTURER\u0092S CUTTING COSTS TO BOOST PROFITS.\r\n\r\nIMHO, THE NHTSA SHOULD TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:\r\n1 - ANY CAR SOLD NEW WITHOUT A USABLE SPARE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND RETROFITTED. \r\n2 - MANUFACTURERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL CARS IN THE USA WITHOUT A USABLE SPARE.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO VOICE MY OPINION.

Any previous printed versions of this bulletin should be discarded. In the event that a Toyota vehicle becomes submerged in water, many components may be physically damaged. Electrical and electronic components, including wiring harnesses, are particularly susceptible to corrosion and subsequent malfunction. Although any flooding can be damaging, salt water flooding elevates the potential for abnormal conditions and may increase risks due to its highly corrosive and conductive nature. Salt residue also continues to corrode and remain conductive even after a vehicle dries. This bulletin is intended to assist with safe handling and inspection of flood damaged vehicles and to provide basic guidance on likely needed repairs.",
