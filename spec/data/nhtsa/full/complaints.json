IT HAS HAPPENED IN ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS, (BUT MOSTLY WHEN WET), AND AT ALL SPEEDS.  I CAN GO WEEKS WITHOUT AN OCCURRENCE, AND THEN IT CAN HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES IN A WEEK.  IT SEEMS TO BE COMPLETELY RANDOM.  I HAVE BEEN TO TWO DEALERSHIPS, AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO DRIVE WITH A TECH WHO FELT THE \"SLIPPAGE\".  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS AND TOLD ME THEY TALKED TO CORPORATE AND THAT A BUMP IN THE ROAD TRIGGERS AN ABS SENSOR TO FIRE, CAUSING THE ABS TO KICK IN.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME TIRE PRESSURE MIGHT AFFECT IT.  NONE OF THIS SITS RIGHT WITH ME BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED DRIVING A CAR WHEN ABS KICKS IN, AND THIS IS NOT THE SENSATION I AM GETTING IN THE PRIUS.  \"SLIPPING\" IS THE BEST ADJECTIVE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT IS TERRIFYING.  THE LAST TIME I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE BRAKES AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE CORPORATE HAD BEEN CONTACTED PREVIOUSLY, THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEM.  THEY DIDN'T KEEP THE CAR, AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD CALL ME BACK WHEN THE CORPORATE REP WOULD BE THERE SO HE COULD DRIVE WITH ME.  THAT WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND THEY HAVEN'T CALLED BACK, OR RETURNED MY CALL.  AT THIS POINT, I FEEL LIKE TOYOTA IS HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME AND I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST IN THE BRAND.  I FEEL LIKE I AM DRIVING AN UNSAFE CAR AND TOYOTA IS IGNORING EVERYTHING I AM SAYING TO THEM.",

ON DEC 20, 2017, GOT A CHIP IN MY WINDSHIELD WHILE DRIVING TO WORK ALONG THE LOCAL HIGHWAY AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT REPAIRED SAME-DAY. IN JUNE 2018, GOT ANOTHER CHIP IN MY WINDSHIELD AND THE CRACK SPREAD BEYOND REPAIR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. STARTED THE PROCESS TO HAVE IT REPLACED AND IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY SIX WEEKS AND THREE APPOINTMENTS WITH SAFELITE BEFORE THEY HAD THE CORRECT WINDSHIELD WITH THE CORRECT PARTS. ACCORDING TO SAFELITE, TOYOTA HAD CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE NEW DESIGN WAS ON BACKORDER. PAID MY $500 DEDUCTIBLE FOR THIS REPLACEMENT. ON AUGUST 8, 2018, JUST A FEW WEEKS AFTER REPLACING THE WINDSHIELD, I GOT ANOTHER CHIP THAT ALSO SPREAD BEYOND REPAIR IMMEDIATELY. AS OF THIS WRITING, I HAVE NOT YET REPLACED THE WINDSHIELD FOR THE SECOND TIME. AFTER DOING RESEARCH, I FOUND THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, FILED IN MARCH 2018, RELATED TO THESE DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELDS.\r\n\r\nATTACHED ARE RECEIPTS FROM SAFELITE SHOWING THE CHIP REPAIR, PAYMENT OF MY DEDUCTIBLE, AND PICTURES OF THE CURRENT CRACK.",

                        "description": "THE VEHICLE STARTED NORMALLY BUT WHEN I REACHED ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE, THE PRIUS STARTED TO ACT AS IF THE ELECTRIC MOTORS WERE NOT ENGAGING. THE ENGINE DID NOT ENGAGE EITHER AND THE GAS PEDAL WAS UNRESPONSIVE.  THE FIRST TIME THIS OCCURRED, I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4-WAY INTERSECTION UNTIL I SHUT DOWN THE VEHICLE AND RESTARTED IT.  AFTER I RESTARTED THE PRIUS, IT CONTINUED BEHAVING ERRATICALLY. IT SOUNDED AND FELT LIKE THE GAS MOTOR HAD ENGAGED BUT THE ELECTRIC MOTOR HAD NOT.  IT ALSO FELT LIKE THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING/NOT ENGAGING AND I HAD TO REV THE MOTOR TO GET THE TRANSMISSION TO ENGAGE (WHICH IT DID WITH A KICK LIKE IT WAS BEING PUT INTO GEAR).  THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES SO FAR.      I HAD A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE ON THE LAST INCIDENT.  I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE INTO  THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES, BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE.  I REACHED OUT TO TOYOTA TO SEE IF THEY COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE, BUT THEY SAID THAT THEIR FIELD TECH WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY PROBLEM.  I AM WORRIED THAT THIS CAR WILL FAIL IN TRAFFIC AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  THE INCIDENT DATES ARE JUNE 20, JULY 2 AND JULY 27, 2018.  THE ONLY INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WAS ABNORMAL ON JULY THE 27TH.   WAS A LOWER MPG READING ON MY DISPLAY.  OTHER THAN THAT, THERE WAS NO WARNING OR ERROR CODES DISPLAYED.",

I HAVE DRIVEN AT LEAST 5 PRIUS PRIME ADVANCED AND ALL HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THAT THE STEERING ASSIST FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK IN ANY OF THEM EVEN THOUGH IT IS ADVERTISED AND SOLD TO THE CONSUMER AS A INTEGRAL PART OF THE TOYOTA SAFETY SUITE THAT IS ON ALL TOYOTA VEHICLES. THIS STEERING ASSIST FUNCTION DOES WORK ON ALL OF THE OTHER TOYOTA MODELS AS ADVERTISED AND AS A CONSUMER WOULD EXPECT. PLEASE REVIEW MY ATTACHED DOCUMENT THAT DESCRIBES THE PROBLEM AND MY ATTEMPTS TO GET TOYOTA TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.

HOWEVER, I SEE AN UNNECESSARY RISK DUE TO THIS DESIGN.\r\n\r\nMY NEW CAR, A 2017 PRIUS 4 TOURING, COMES WITH NO SPARE TIRE. THERE ARE THREE PRIUS MODELS LIKE THAT, EVEN FOR THE 2018 MODEL YEAR. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE RELATED SAFETY ASPECTS OF THAT TOYOTA DECISION?\r\n\r\nIN THE WESTERN US, ESPECIALLY, THERE ARE MANY PAVED ROADS WITH LITTLE OR NO TRAFFIC AND SPOTTY, IF ANY, CELL PHONE SERVICE. TYPICALLY, THEY ARE IN DESERT AREAS, SCORCHING IN THE SUMMER, FRIGID IN WINTER, WITH TOWNS FAR APART. IF A DRIVER OF A CAR LIKE MINE HAS A TIRE BLOWOUT IN SUCH A REMOTE AREA, HE/SHE IS LITERALLY STRANDED. THE SUPPLIED TIRE REPAIR KIT WILL NOT HELP IN CASE OF A BLOWOUT. AVERAGE OWNERS WILL NOT EVEN KNOW THEY ARE WITHOUT A SPARE TIRE UNTIL THEY NEED ONE.\r\n\r\nMORE THAN AN INCONVENIENCE, THIS COULD BE FATAL TO THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS IN EXTREME HEAT OR COLD. THE DRIVER\u0092S ONLY HOPE IS THAT ANOTHER VEHICLE WILL HAPPEN ALONG TO HELP. A RISK LIKE THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY A MANUFACTURER\u0092S CUTTING COSTS TO BOOST PROFITS.\r\n\r\nIMHO, THE NHTSA SHOULD TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:\r\n1 - ANY CAR SOLD NEW WITHOUT A USABLE SPARE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND RETROFITTED. \r\n2 - MANUFACTURERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL CARS IN THE USA WITHOUT A USABLE SPARE.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO VOICE MY OPINION.
